# Java Config Generator

Java Config Generator is a tool for generating template JSON configuration files. The tool is built from [gson](https://github.com/google/gson). The tool extends the functionality of GSON by generating template configuration files from marked by Java annotations. The annoatations provide the abillity to input custom data such as display name, description, or validators.

The goal of the generated JSON configuration files is to be used by a web application. The web application would read the generated template JSON configuration file, and use it to create a web form. The custom configuration would be sent back via JSON to the Java application for it to be used.
